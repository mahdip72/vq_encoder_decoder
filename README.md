# Vector Quantize Encoder-Decoder Model of 3D Structures

This is a research project regarding a vector quantize encoder-decoder model of protein 3D structure.
The vector quantize model is based on the original paper
"Neural Discrete Representation Learning" by Aaron van den Oord, Oriol Vinyals, and Koray Kavukcuoglu. 
The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937).

Here is a great repo of different pytorch implementation of VQ-VAE models: [repository](https://github.com/lucidrains/vector-quantize-pytorch)
